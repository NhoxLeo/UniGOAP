# UniLife
A work-in-progress Unity3D framework for simulating NPCs and cyber life forms for application in Live Simulations, video games and similar media.

# Intro
This project is being made for self driven cinematic simulations, inspired by the works of Ian Cheng.  
  
This repository currently contains code for simulating NPCs in the simulation. The decision making of these NPCs are driven by the a finite state machine. Currently, much of the code for this is being developed from the State Design chapter in the book Programming Game AI by Example by Mat Buckland.  
  
# Soon / Next  
- Features to add more behaviour with more type safety  
- Pathfinding using Unity's NavMeshAgent as a component of the UniLife Agent
