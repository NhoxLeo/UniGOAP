# UniLife
A work-in-progress Unity3D solution for intellignt NPCs for use in video games, simulations and similar media.

# Intro
This project uses Goal Orienced Action Planning to create intelligent agents. Good explaination [here](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/goal-oriented-action-planning-for-a-smarter-ai--cms-20793). As of now, it is almost identical to the [repository referenced in the article](https://github.com/sploreg/goap).   

For more material on `GOAP`, refer to works by Jeff Orkin of Monolith Productions and F.E.A.R. game AI related material. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78nhJNPS0vA) by Nicolas Meuleau of Unity Technologies also appears to borrow from GOAP concepts.  
  
# Next  
- Support for something similar to `Func<bool>` and `Actions()` as preconditions and effects respectively for agent actions. Allowing for more sophisticated state change operation than just `bool` flags  

# Note
- This project was initially started with an approach based on the `State Design Pattern` discussed in Programming Game AI by Example written by Mat Buckland. The scope of the project soon became too large for FSM based agents. That code is now [here](https://github.com/adrenak/UniFSM)
