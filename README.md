# UniLife
A work-in-progress Unity3D solution for intellignt NPCs for use in video games, simulations and similar media.

# Intro
This project currently has two approaches for simulating NPCs:-  
- `State Design Pattern` The code in this repository for this is largely based on the State Machine related chapters in `Programming Game AI by Example (Mat Buckland)`. This approach however only suitably works for simpler AI. 
- `Goal Oriented Action Planning` Good explaination here [an article by Brent Owens](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/goal-oriented-action-planning-for-a-smarter-ai--cms-20793). As of now, it is almost identical to the [repository referenced in the article](https://github.com/sploreg/goap). Further development is planned using `GOAP`.  
  
# Next  
- Integration with Unity `NavMesh` for pathfinding.
- Some type safety in declaring `Action` preconditions and effects.
